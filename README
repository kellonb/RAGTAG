To run RAGTAG (but look at examples in the manual and in the test case directory)
 ./genA -i genA_input -p parmfile -r molecule.restart -s molecule_4p.scores -f molecule_4p.frcmod -y molecule_4p.fit -o molecule_4p.log
# to restart your previous run
./genA -i genA_input -p parmfile.1 -c molecule_4p.restart -r molecule_4p.restart1 -s molecule_4p.scores1 -f molecule_4p.frcmod1 -y molecule_4p.fit1 -o molecule_4p.log1

# the scripts directory has some useful scripts, Details on those are coming soon
